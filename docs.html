            <h2>ABOUT THE LIL HELPER: 
                <br />
                A BETTER WAY TO IMPORT</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> takes the heartache and pain out of importing Magento orders into MOM.
            </p>
            <p>For anyone who uses Bizsync to import orders from Magento to MOM,
                the <strong>LIL Helper</strong> makes things easier by taking out the guess-work.
            </p>
            <p>Every MOM import has its potential dangers: shipping methods that need correction,
                special orders, high-risk orders, it's a lot to look for. The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong>
                finds these problems, and brings them to your attention. The means less time looking for potential
                problems in an order, and more time fixing actual problems.
            </p>
            <p>The program takes the Bizsync file used in MOM/Magento import, and parses it into a readable list of
                potential problems with orders.</p>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can also take a CSV order file from Magento's Extended Orders page to
                look
                for more issues.</p>
            <p>Using the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is as easy as selecting two files from your computer.</p>

            <h2>FEATURES</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can detect the <b>following issues</b> in a MOM import:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a customer has overpaid for expedited shipping.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i><b>For example,</b> if they paid for <b>three-day shipping,</b> but live inside your
                            company's
                            <b>two-day shipping zone.</b></i></li>
                </ul>
                <li>A <b>UPS shipment</b> headed for a <b>PO Box.</b></li>
                <li>A <b>UPS Residential shipment</b> headed to a <b>commercial address.</b></li>
                <li>A <b>domestic UPS shipment</b> headed <b>outside the contiguous US.</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i><b>For example,</b> an order headed to <b>Hawaii, Alaska,</b> or <b>Puerto Rico.</b></i></li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>International orders.</b></li>
                <li>An order that has a <b>labor</b> code or <b>special order</b> code, specific to your company.</li>
                <li>Orders where the first digit of a phone number is '1'.</li>
                <li>Multiple orders from the same customer, which may be combined.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you combine a <b>Magento order file</b> with your <b>MOM import file</b>, you can look for these
                additional issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-value orders <b>requiring a signature.</b></li>
                <li>High-value orders <b>requiring insurance.</b></li>
                <li>Orders with a <b>high-fraud risk.</b></li>
                <li><b>False positives</b> on high-fraud risk orders, due to being placed by a <b>CSR.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> has <b>additional features</b> to make importing easier:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Auto-generated MOM Chat notifications for starting and ending imports.</li>
                <li><b>Click-to-copy</b> for common phrases, like your company's <b>Alternate search ID</b></li>
                <li>An <b>insurance calculator</b>, for quickly finding the insurance amount on an order, without
                    needing to
                    leave the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is <b>built for security:</b> all information specific to your company,
                like IP addresses
                and labor codes, <strong> is stored locally, <i>not</i> on a server. <em>Take control of your
                        information!</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>The following features are <b>IN-DEVELOPMENT</b> for <strong>MOM'S LIL HELPER:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect orders where items have <b>special packing requirements.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="setup">
            <h2>SETTING UP THE LIL HELPER</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LIL Helper</strong> requires information specific to your company in order to work.</p>
            <p>This information is securely stored in your browser's local storage, it is not stored on a server.</p>
            <p>Once this information is entered by the user, it can be stored indefinitely, and updated if needed.</p>
            <p>User info can be added, removed, or modified in the SETTINGS section</p>

            <ol>
                <li>To access user settings, load the <strong>LIL Helper</strong>,
                    and click the SHOW SETTINGS button in the <strong>top-right corner</strong> of the screen.
                    <img style="width:60%;" alt="location of the button to show settings" title="location of the button to show settings" src="images/showSettingsLocation.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>When the SHOW SETTINGS button is clicked, it will reveal the setting section in the lower
                    half of the screen.
                    <img alt="the LIL Helper settings panel" title="the LIL Helper settings panel" src="images/settingsPanelFull.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Company Name </strong> will be displayed when you submit your MOM Chat messages about
                    starting/ending the import.
                    <img alt="the company name input field" title="the company name input field" src="images/companyName.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>MOM Folder Validation String</strong> is a set of characters always found at the
                    beginning of the Bizsync file.
                    The LIL Helper checks for this sequence of characters to make reasonably sure that you're using the
                    correct file.
                    <img alt="the MOM Folder Validation string input" title="the MOM Folder Validation string input" src="images/momFolderValidationString.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Magento Admin Folder Validation String</strong> is the same thing, but for the CSV file
                    output from Magento.
                    <img alt="the Magento Admin Folder Validation string input" title="the Magento Admin Folder Validation string input" src="images/magentoAdminFolderValidationString.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Alternate ID</strong> is a code your company might use to quickly look up the
                    most-recent orders brought into MOM.
                    <img alt="Alternate ID input" title="Alternate ID input" src="images/alternateID.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>Your <strong>Company IP Address</strong> is used to check for false-positives from Magento's fraud
                    detection.
                    When you process a customer's credit card, Magento's fraud detection will see a payment made with
                    the customer's card, hundreds or
                    thousands of miles away from the customer's billing address. Magento will usually assume that the
                    card has been stolen, and give a
                    high fraud risk to the order. The LIL Helper will check the IP address of an order against your
                    company's IP address, and use that
                    to detect a false positive.
                    <img alt="Company IP Address input" alt="Company IP Address input" src="images/companyIPAddress.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Start and End times</strong> are used to narrow down the number of orders displayed, so
                    the LIL Helper
                    will only show orders relevant to your import. This is especially important if you are only using
                    the CSV order file from Magento.
                    <img alt="import times input fields" title="import times input fields" src="images/importTimes.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>Sometimes, an order placed by customer service will have special instructions associated with it.
                    The <strong>special order code</strong>
                    is sometimes used to flag orders with special instructions.
                    <img alt="special order code input field" title="special order code input field" src="images/specialOrder.PNG" />
                    <p><strong>NOTE: The following items may require special attention to set up.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>Some orders require special packing. For example, orders that contain one large item, and several
                    small items, might require
                    two boxes instead of one. Make a list of all items in your MOM inventory that might require special
                    packing.
                    <strong>Separate items with commas and no spaces.</strong>
                    <img alt="special labor codes input field" title="special labor codes input field" src="images/specialLaborCodes.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The next three fields are used to help detect shipping problems with orders. For each of these
                    fields, use official state abbreviations,
                    and separate values by commas with no spaces.

                    <p>For this example, we have assumed that the shipping warehouse is located in <b>Colorado</b>.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The <strong>One-Day Zone</strong> includes all US states where you could deliver <strong>UPS
                                Ground packages</strong> within one business day.
                            <img alt="one-day shipping zone input field" title="one-day shipping zone input field" src="images/oneDayZone.PNG" />
                        </li>
                        <li>Next, list all states in the <strong>Two-Day Zone</strong> for your company.
                            <img alt="two-day shipping zone input field" title="two-day shipping zone input field" src="images/twoDayZone.PNG" />
                        </li>
                        <li>Lastly, list all remaining states in the Contiguous (Lower-48) states US.
                            <img alt="rest of lower 48 states input fields" title="rest of lower 48 states input field" src="images/restOfLower48.PNG" />
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If an order is shipping within the US, but outside the Lower 48 states (like Alaska or Hawaii),
                        the LIL Helper will automatically recognize that.</p>
                    <p>All orders not shipping to a recognized US state or territory will be automatically classified as
                        an <strong>international order</strong>.</p>
                    <p>If you notice any strange shipping notifications while using the LIL Helper, it may be due to a
                        mistake in these fields.</p>
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>High-Value Order Threshold</strong> is the dollar amount at which your company deems an
                    order to be high-value. These orders
                    may require a signature and/or insurance, and will probably need to be considered carefully. Your
                    company may require these orders have
                    matching billing/shipping addresses, or other special considerations.
                    <img alt="high-value order threshold input field" title="high-value order threshold input field" src="images/highValueOrderThreshold.PNG" />
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Fraud Risk Threshold</strong> is the minimum Magento fraud risk score that your company
                    considers suspicious. These orders
                    may require special care. The LIL Helper will help detect false-positives caused by customer service
                    placing the order.
                    <img alt="high fraud risk threshold input field" title="high fraud risk threshold input field" src="images/fraudRiskThreshold.PNG" />
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>These values are stored in local storage in your browser, they are not stored on a
                    server.</strong></p>
            <h2 id="savingAndLoadingSettings">SAVING/LOADING YOUR SETTINGS</h2>
            <p>In some cases, it may be useful for co-workers to share settings, rather than have everyone go through the setup process separately.</p>
            <p>The LIL Helper makes it easy to copy your user settings, or load in someone else's</p>
            <p><strong>To export your settings,</strong> click the button labeled <strong>Copy Settings to Clipboard</strong> 
            in the <strong>bottom-right</strong> of the settings panel.</p>
            <img alt="button to copy settings to clipboard" title="button to copy settings to clipboard" src="images/copySettingsToClipboard.PNG" />
            <p>Then, open a new email or text document, and hit <kbd>Control + v</kbd> to paste the settings. It will look something like this:</p>
            <img alt="raw settings in text editor" title="what raw settings will look like in a text editor" src="images/copySettingsResults.PNG" />
            <p>Do not be alarmed, it's supposed to look like that. You now have the raw LIL Helper settings that someone else can load into their program.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>To load someone else's user settings into your computer,</strong> click the <strong>LOAD SETTINGS</strong> 
            button in the <strong>bottom-left</strong> of the settings panel.</p>
            <img alt="load settings button" title="load settings button" src="images/loadSettingsButton.PNG" />
            <p>After clicking <strong>LOAD SETTINGS</strong>, you will receive a prompt, asking you to paste a 'settings string'.</p>
            <img alt="'paste settings' prompt" title="'paste settings' prompt" src="images/pasteSettingsPrompt.PNG" />
            <p>Paste the raw settings info from earlier, and click <strong>OK</strong></p>
            <p>The settings will be automatically loaded into the LIL Helper, and saved into the browser's local storage.</p>

                    <p>As a safeguard against this, the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong>
                        will warn you before parsing the files to double-check that
                        your import file is ready.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>If the import XML file is ready, click 'OK'</b>
                    <p>The submitted files will be parsed and merged into
                        a single collection of data.</p>
                    <p>The program will terminate under the following conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If <em>no files</em> have been selected.</li>
                        <li>If the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> does not recognize the file.</li>
                        <li>If either file is in the incorrect place,
                            for example, the CSV file is loaded in the area meant for the XML file.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If only one file is used, and is in the correct place,
                        the program will still work, but not as much information will be processed.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using only the <strong>import XML file</strong> will provide information about
                                <strong>shipping, special labor codes, special packaging, and phone numbers.</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li>Using only the <strong>Magento CSV file</strong> will provide information about
                                <strong>the value of an order, signature/insurance requirements, fraud risk, and fraud
                                    risk false-positives.</strong></li>
                            <li>Using either spreadsheet provides information on <strong>multiple orders by one customer
                                    within the same import.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You will receive an alert, giving the number of orders the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> found.
                After dismissing the alert, the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> will display a table of parsed information.
            </p>
            <p>After a moment, the program will <em>automatically</em> scroll to the bottom of the
                table. You should start at the bottom, and work your way up through the orders.</p>
            <p>There will occasionally be a small discrepancy between the number of orders processed
                by the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> and the number of orders in your MOM import.
