            <h2>A BETTER WAY TO IMPORT</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> takes the heartache and pain out of importing Magento orders into MOM.
            </p>
            <p>Every MOM import has its potential dangers: shipping methods that need correction,
                special orders, high-risk orders, it's a lot to look for. The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong>
                finds these problems, and brings them to your attention. The means less time looking for potential
                problems in an order, and more time fixing actual problems.
            </p>
            <p>The program takes the Bizsync file used in MOM/Magento import, and parses it into a readable list of
                potential problems with orders.</p>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can also take a CSV order file from Magento's Extended Orders page to
                look
                for more issues.</p>
            <p>Using the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is as easy as selecting two files from your computer.</p>

            <h2>FEATURES</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can detect the <b>following issues</b> in a MOM import:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a customer has overpaid for expedited shipping.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i><b>For example,</b> if they paid for <b>three-day shipping,</b> but live inside your
                            company's
                            <b>two-day shipping zone.</b></i></li>
                </ul>
                <li>A <b>UPS shipment</b> headed for a <b>PO Box.</b></li>
                <li>A <b>UPS Residential shipment</b> headed to a <b>commercial address.</b></li>
                <li>A <b>domestic UPS shipment</b> headed <b>outside the contiguous US.</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i><b>For example,</b> an order headed to <b>Hawaii, Alaska,</b> or <b>Puerto Rico.</b></i></li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>International orders.</b></li>
                <li>An order that has a <b>labor</b> code or <b>special order</b> code, specific to your company.</li>
                <li>Orders where the first digit of a phone number is '1'.</li>
                <li>Multiple orders from the same customer, which may be combined.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you combine a <b>Magento order file</b> with your <b>MOM import file</b>, you can look for these
                additional issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-value orders <b>requiring a signature.</b></li>
                <li>High-value orders <b>requiring insurance.</b></li>
                <li>Orders with a <b>high-fraud risk.</b></li>
                <li><b>False positives</b> on high-fraud risk orders, due to being placed by a <b>CSR.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> has <b>additional features</b> to make importing easier:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Auto-generated MOM Chat notifications for starting and ending imports.</li>
                <li><b>Click-to-copy</b> for common phrases, like your company's <b>Alternate search ID</b></li>
                <li>An <b>insurance calculator</b>, for quickly finding the insurance amount on an order, without
                    needing to
                    leave the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is <b>built for security:</b> all information specific to your company,
                like IP addresses
                and labor codes, <strong> is stored locally, <i>not</i> on a server. <em>Own your
                        information!</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>The following features are <b>IN-DEVELOPMENT</b> for <strong>MOM'S LIL HELPER:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect orders where items have <b>special packing requirements.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Load the Bizsync Orders.xml file</b></li>
                <li><b>Load the Magento Orders.csv file</b></li>
                <li><b>Parse the files by clicking the Parse Files Button</b></li>
                <li><b>Click PARSE FILES</b>
                    <p>This will convert both files into a format that the LIL Helper can use.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Double-check that the MOM import is ready.</b>
                    <p>Never assume that just because the clock says 
                        it's time for your import, that the import file is ready.
                        The Bizsync Orders.xml file may arrive early, or late.
                        Don't make the mistake of importing orders that were 
                        already imported, that means nothing but a lot of needless
                        cleanup.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a safeguard against this, the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong>
                    will warn you before parsing the files to double-check that 
                    your import file is ready.
                    </p>
