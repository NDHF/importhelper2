        <h2>A BETTER WAY TO IMPORT</h2>
        <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> takes the heartache and pain out of importing Magento orders into MOM.</p>
        <p>The program takes the Bizsync file used in MOM/Magento import, and parses it into a readable list of potential problems with orders.</p>
        <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can also take a CSV order file from Magento's Extended Orders page to look for more issues.</p>
        <p>Using the <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is as easy as selecting two files from your computer.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>FEATURES</h2>
        <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> can detect the <b>following issues</b> in a MOM import:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a customer has overpaid for expedited shipping.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>For example,</b> if they paid for <b>three-day shipping,</b> but live inside your company's <b>two-day shipping zone.</b></i></li>
            </ul>
            <li>A <b>UPS shipment</b> headed for a <b>PO Box.</b></li>
            <li>A <b>UPS Residential shipment</b> headed to a <b>commercial address.</b></li>
            <li>A <b>domestic UPS shipment</b> headed <b>outside the contiguous US.</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>For example,</b> an order headed to <b>Hawaii, Alaska,</b> or <b>Puerto Rico.</b></i></li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>International orders.</b></li>
            <li>An order that has a <b>labor</b> code or <b>special order</b> code, specific to your company.</li>
            <li>Orders where the first digit of a phone number is '1'.</li>
            <li>Multiple orders from the same customer, which may be combined.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you combine a <b>Magento order file</b> with your <b>MOM import file</b>, you can look for these additional issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-value orders <b>requiring a signature.</b></li>
            <li>High-value orders <b>requiring insurance.</b></li>
            <li>Orders with a <b>high-fraud risk.</b></li>
            <li><b>False positives</b> on high-fraud risk orders, due to being placed by a <b>CSR.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> has <b>additional features</b> to make importing easier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-generated MOM Chat notifications for starting and ending imports.</li>
            <li><b>Click-to-copy</b> for common phrases, like your company's <b>Alternate search ID</b></li>
            <li>An <b>insurance calculator</b>, for quickly finding the insurance amount on an order, without needing to leave the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>LIL HELPER</strong> is <b>built for security:</b> all information specific to your company, like IP addresses 
            and labor codes, <strong> is stored locally, <i>not</i> on a server. <em>Own your information!</em></strong> </p>
        <p>The following features are <b>IN-DEVELOPMENT</b> for <strong>MOM'S LIL HELPER:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect orders where items have <b>special packing requirements.</b></li>
        </ul>
